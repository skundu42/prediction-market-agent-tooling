# I tried to make it return a JSON, but it didn't work well in combo with asking it to do chain of thought.
QUESTION_EVALUATE_PROMPT = """Main signs about an answerable question (sometimes referred to as a "market"):
- The question needs to be specific, without use of pronouns.
- The question needs to have a clear future event.
- The question needs to have a clear time frame.
- The answer is probably Google-able, after the event happened.
- The question can not be about itself.

Follow a chain of thought to evaluate if the question is answerable:

First, write the parts of the following question:

"{question}"

Then, write down what is the future event of the question, what it referrs to and when that event will happen if the question contains it.

Then, give your final decision, write `decision: ` followed by either "yes" or "no" about whether the question is answerable. Don't write anything else after the decision.
